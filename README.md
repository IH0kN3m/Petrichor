- **Playlist Support**: Create and manage custom playlists (in development)
- **Smart Search**: Find tracks quickly (planned)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Native macOS Integration

- **System Audio**: Uses AVFoundation for high-quality audio playback
- **Security Bookmarks**: Secure access to user-selected folders
- **Now Playing Integration**: Shows current track in Control Center and Lock Screen
- **Native UI**: Follows macOS design guidelines with proper system colors and spacing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

- macOS 15.4 or later
- Xcode 16.3 or later
- Swift 5.0

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Petrichor.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project

### First Time Setup

1. Launch Petrichor
2. Go to **Folders** tab
3. Click **Add Folder** to select directories containing your music
4. The app will automatically scan and import your music files

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Petrichor follows a clean, modular architecture:

### Core Components

- **Models**: `Track`, `Playlist`, `Folder` - Data structures
- **Managers**: Business logic and state management
  - `LibraryManager` - Music library and folder management
  - `AudioPlayerManager` - Audio playback control
  - `PlaylistManager` - Playlist operations and playback queue
  - `NowPlayingManager` - macOS Now Playing integration
- **Views**: SwiftUI views organized by feature
- **Application**: App coordination and lifecycle management

### Key Design Patterns

- **MVVM Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **ObservableObject**: Reactive state management
- **Dependency Injection**: Managers are injected through environment objects
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Modular, reusable components

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Project Structure

```
Petrichor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application/           # App entry point and coordination
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/               # Data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Managers/             # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/                # SwiftUI views
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Assets.xcassets/      # App icons and resources
```

### SQLite Schema

- **folders** - Stores music folders with security-scoped bookmarks
- **tracks** - Comprehensive music metadata with 35+ fields including extended metadata as JSON
- **playlists** - Both regular and smart playlists with criteria
- **playlist_tracks** - Junction table for many-to-many relationship between playlists and tracks

Key relationships:

- Each folder can contain multiple tracks (one-to-many)
- Playlists and tracks have a many-to-many relationship through `playlist_tracks`
- All foreign keys have CASCADE delete to maintain referential integrity
